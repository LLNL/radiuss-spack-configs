  # Note: unlike projects using RADIUSS Spack
  # Configs, Serac is using "$spack/.." as the root
  # of Spack cache directories. We share the goal of
  # making sure that Spack instances do not collide,
  # our choice supposes that $user_cache_path is
  # defined to that purpose, but Serac is enforcing
  # it for the cache directories.
  # The reason for not adopting the same strategy as
  # Serac is because there are other directories
  # created by Spack that need to be porperly
  # isolated. Therefore, setting the
  # "user_cache_path" properly is still mandatory.
